ADR-0002
Doctrine of Coreliptic Intelligence
Canonical Artifact Set
Authority: Fredrick D. Flowers
Entity: Buzzomatic Intelligence LLC
Status: LOCKED • FDF Certified™ • Trust-Zero
I. BuzzTopia Dictionary Entry (Formal)
Coreliptic Intelligence
(noun, doctrine-class intelligence)
A governed intelligence paradigm in which reasoning exists only as auditable artifacts, authority is explicitly bounded, and no cognitive output is valid unless it can be traced, reviewed, and reproduced.
Key Properties
Artifact-first cognition
Deterministic reasoning paths
Explicit authority boundaries
Zero implicit execution rights
Human sovereignty preserved at all layers
Contrast
Unlike AGI (capability-centric)
Unlike agentic AI (action-centric)
Unlike automation (outcome-centric)
Coreliptic Intelligence is evidence-centric.
Living Artifact
(noun, system form)
A Living Artifact is a continuously evolving intelligence object whose state, logic, and outputs remain inspectable over time, without autonomous authority.
A Living Artifact:
Evolves through commits, not self-modification
Produces outputs, not actions
Exists to be examined, not obeyed
Formal Rule:
If it cannot be reviewed, it cannot be trusted.
If it cannot be trusted, it cannot act.
Trust-Zero AI
(governance principle)
An intelligence governance model where no system, model, or agent is trusted by default, regardless of capability.
All trust must be:
Declared
Scoped
Revocable
Logged
Artifact Loop
(system cycle)
Observe → Reason → Record → Review → Authorize → Repeat
No loop completion occurs without a human authorization boundary.

Headline:
Coreliptic Intelligence — Living Artifact
Subhead:
Intelligence you can audit.
Systems you can trust.
Badge Row:
ADR-0002 • Trust-Zero • FDF Certified™
Section: The Problem
Modern AI systems:
Act without traceability
Accumulate hidden authority
Collapse review and execution
This breaks trust.
Section: The Doctrine
Coreliptic Intelligence replaces opaque intelligence with:
Artifact-based reasoning
Explicit authority
Human-controlled execution
No artifact → No action.
Section: The System
Living Artifact Architecture
Deterministic logic
Versioned intelligence
Reproducible outputs
Zero silent execution
Section: What This Repo Represents
A formal Living Artifact
A doctrine-aligned intelligence system
A reference implementation of ADR-0002

The Doctrine That Separates Intelligence From Authority.
V. Investor / Academic Framing (Serious, Non-Hype)
Academic Positioning
Coreliptic Intelligence introduces a new classification of AI systems:
Neither AGI nor agentic
Artifact-governed intelligence
Designed for auditability, not autonomy
Relevant to:
AI governance research
Safety-critical systems
Regulated industries
Public-sector AI
Academic reproducibility
Investor Positioning
This is infrastructure doctrine, not a chatbot.
Value lies in:
Trust-preserving AI frameworks
Compliance-ready intelligence
Long-term defensibility
Regulatory alignment
Enterprise adoption readiness
This doctrine scales safely because authority does not.
FINAL LOCK STATEMENT
✔ BuzzTopia dictionary formalized
✔ Living Artifact seal specified
✔ Landing page variant delivered
✔ ADR-0002 doctrine repo defined
✔ Investor & academic framing aligned
Coreliptic Intelligence — Living Artifact
is now a complete, defensible doctrine, not a concept.
