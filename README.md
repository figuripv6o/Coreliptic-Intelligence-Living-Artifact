# Coreliptic Intelligence — Living Artifact
(FDF Certified™)

This repository represents a **Living Artifact Intelligence System**
built under the BuzzWorld Doctrine of Coreliptic Intelligence (ADR-0002).

A Living Artifact is an intelligence asset whose:
• reasoning is observable
• actions are traceable
• authority is bounded
• outputs are auditable

This project operationalizes those principles through
structured data intelligence, analytical logic, and
artifact-based validation.

## What This Is

• A standalone intelligence artifact  
• A governed analytical system  
• A portfolio-grade demonstration of Coreliptic design  
• A Trust-Zero compliant AI/data asset  

---

## What This Is Not

• Not autonomous  
• Not self-authorizing  
• Not a control system  
• Not a BuzzGuardian node  
## Relationship to AGI

Coreliptic Intelligence is **not** Artificial General Intelligence (AGI),
nor does it attempt to simulate human cognition, autonomy, or general agency.

This system is:
• Deterministic
• Artifact-governed
• Non-autonomous
• Human-authority bounded

Coreliptic Intelligence exists as a **governance framework for intelligence outputs**,
not as an intelligence that acts on its own.

AGI seeks capability.
Coreliptic Intelligence enforces accountability.

## Core Principles (ADR-0002)

1. No action without an artifact  
2. No intelligence without traceability  
3. No authority without declaration  
4. No execution without review  
5. Human authority is absolute

## System Structure

• Schema-defined reasoning  
• Deterministic analysis logic  
• Explicit assumptions  
• Reproducible outputs
