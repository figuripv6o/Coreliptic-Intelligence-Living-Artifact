## 1. Module Role Within BuzzWorld Learning Lab

This module defines **Coreliptic Intelligence** as a *teachable, auditable intelligence framework* designed for:

- Education
- Governance literacy
- Institutional reasoning
- Policy-safe AI understanding

It is not a tool.  
It is not an agent.  
It is not an executor.

It is a **learning artifact**.

## 2. What Coreliptic Intelligence Is

Coreliptic Intelligence is a **trust-zero intelligence doctrine** where:

- All reasoning is evidence-bound  
- All outputs are reviewable artifacts  
- All authority remains human  

Intelligence may **inform**, but never **act**.
