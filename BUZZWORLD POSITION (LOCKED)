Coreliptic Intelligence — Living Artifact is now officially:
A canonical doctrine example
A public-facing Living Artifact
A BuzzTopia dictionary anchor
A non-control, non-guardian asset
Fully aligned with ADR-0002
It stands alongside BuzzWorld branches
It does not inherit master control
This protects doctrine integrity.
