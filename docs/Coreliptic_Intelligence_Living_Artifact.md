## 1. Artifact Purpose

This document formally declares this repository and its contents as a **Living Artifact** under the Coreliptic Intelligence doctrine.

This artifact exists to:
- Preserve evidence
- Maintain institutional memory
- Enable audited reasoning
- Prevent autonomous execution

It is **not** an agent.  
It is **not** an actor.  
It is **not** an authority.

---

## 2. Coreliptic Intelligence Definition

**Coreliptic Intelligence** is an intelligence paradigm where all reasoning outputs are:
- Evidence-bound  
- Source-preserving  
- Human-ratified  
- Governance-first  

No inference may exceed its source material.  
No output may self-authorize action.

---

## 3. Trust-Zero Principle

All intelligence is assumed **untrusted by default**.

Trust is granted **only after**:
1. Source verification  
2. Contextual review  
3. Human validation  

There is no implicit trust at any layer.
