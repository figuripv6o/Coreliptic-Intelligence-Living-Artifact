# Coreliptic Intelligence  
## Living Artifact Curriculum Module  
### BuzzWorld Learning Lab (DDL / EDU-C Center)

**Module Name:** Coreliptic Intelligence  
**Artifact Class:** Living Artifact  
**Doctrine Binding:** ADR-0002 — Doctrine of Coreliptic Intelligence  
**Status:** LOCKED · NON-AUTONOMOUS · TRUST-ZERO  

**Authority:** Fredrick D. Flowers  
**Entity:** Buzzomatic Intelligence LLC  
**Program:** BuzzWorld Learning Lab™

## 1. Module Purpose

This module establishes **Coreliptic Intelligence** as a **governance-safe, educational intelligence framework**.

It exists to teach:
- How intelligence can be structured without agency
- Why trust-zero models are required in public systems
- How evidence becomes policy-relevant without automation
- How Living Artifacts preserve truth over time

This module is instructional only.  
It performs no actions and authorizes no decisions.

---

## 2. Definition: Coreliptic Intelligence

**Coreliptic Intelligence** is a doctrine in which intelligence outputs exist **only** as:

- Evidence-bound artifacts  
- Source-preserving records  
- Human-ratified reasoning  
- Institutionally auditable objects  

Intelligence may **inform** decisions.  
Intelligence may **never execute** decisions.

---

## 3. Trust-Zero Intelligence Model

All intelligence within this module follows a **trust-zero assumption**:

- No output is trusted by default  
- No reasoning is self-authoritative  
- No inference exceeds its source  

Trust is granted **only after**:
1. Source verification  
2. Contextual review  
3. Human validation  

---

## 4. Living Artifact Constraints (Educational Enforcement)

This module enforces the following immutable constraints:

### Prohibited
- ❌ Autonomous execution  
- ❌ Agent frameworks  
- ❌ Self-directed reasoning  
- ❌ Policy authorship  

### Required
- ✅ Source tracing  
- ✅ Version lineage  
- ✅ Human validation checkpoints  
- ✅ Institutional compatibility  

Violation of these constraints invalidates educational use.

## 5. Canonical Artifact Loop (Taught Model)

All learners are taught the following loop as **complete and final**:• A Trust-Zero compliant AI/data asset  

---

## What This Is Not

• Not autonomous  
• Not self-authorizing  
• Not a control system  
• Not a BuzzGuardian node  
## Relationship to AGI

Coreliptic Intelligence is **not** Artificial General Intelligence (AGI),
nor does it attempt to simulate human cognition, autonomy, or general agency.

This system is:
• Deterministic
• Artifact-governed
• Non-autonomous
• Human-authority bounded

Coreliptic Intelligence exists as a **governance framework for intelligence outputs**,
not as an intelligence that acts on its own.

AGI seeks capability.
Coreliptic Intelligence enforces accountability.
---

## Core Principles (ADR-0002)

1. No action without an artifact  
2. No intelligence without traceability  
3. No authority without declaration  
4. No execution without review  
5. Human authority is absolute  

---

## System Structure

• Schema-defined reasoning  
• Deterministic analysis logic  
• Explicit assumptions  
• Reproducible outputs
