Abstract
This paper introduces Coreliptic Intelligence, a governance-first intelligence model in which reasoning systems are constrained to operate exclusively as auditable artifacts. Unlike agentic or autonomous AI systems, Coreliptic Intelligence prohibits self-authorizing execution, preserving human authority and traceability across all decision surfaces.
